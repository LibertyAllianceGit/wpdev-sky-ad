Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that fixes the sky box ad, so that it's Google compliant. No overlay ads here!

---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. You're done, the plugin is working!
